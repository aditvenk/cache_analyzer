# cache_analyzer
A python tool useful for analyzing cache dumps obtained from GEM5 simulator. The tool can detect frequently occurring data patterns, efficacy of common compression algorithms in compressing this dump etc. The tool is not completely polished for external use, but there're plenty of comments to guide the way. I will clean up the tool when I'm free.
